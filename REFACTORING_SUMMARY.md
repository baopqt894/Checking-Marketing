# Account Management Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring changes made to the account management system to separate user creation from account editing, enforce admin-only user creation, and integrate user management with proper authentication.

## Key Changes

### 1. Edit Account Modal Refactoring
**File**: `components/accountManagement/edit-account-modal.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Removed all app assignment functionality
- ✅ Removed app viewing features
- ✅ Simplified modal to only allow editing account information:
  - Name
  - Private Email
  - Company Email
  - Admin Role (toggle) - Changed from "Leader Role"
- ✅ Clean, focused UI for account info editing only

**Label Changes**:
- "Leader Role" → "Admin Role"

**Previous Functionality (Removed)**:
- App assignment interface
- Available apps list
- Assigned apps management
- App-related API calls

### 2. Create Account Modal Update
**File**: `components/accountManagement/create-account-modal.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Label changed from "Leader Account" to "Admin Account"
- Maintains same functionality for creating accounts

### 3. User Creation Modal (New)
**File**: `components/accountManagement/create-user-modal.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ New dedicated modal for creating users
- ✅ Admin-only access (role-based restriction from cookie)
- ✅ Uses the correct API endpoint: `POST /users`
- ✅ Required fields:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Password (min 6 characters)
  - Role (admin or user)
- ✅ Access control:
  - Checks user role from authentication cookie
  - Shows "Access Denied" message for non-admin users
  - Backend validation on submit

**API Endpoint**:
```
POST {NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BACKEND_URL}/users
Body: {
  name: string
  email: string
  password: string
  role: "admin" | "user"
}
```

### 4. User Table Component (New)
**File**: `components/accountManagement/user-table.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Displays users in a clean table format
- ✅ Shows user information:
  - Name (with admin/user icon)
  - Email
  - Role badge (Admin/User)
  - Created date
  - Last updated date
- ✅ Role-based styling:
  - Admin users: Shield icon + default badge
  - Regular users: User icon + secondary badge
- ✅ Empty state with helpful message
- ✅ Uses date-fns for date formatting

**Data Fields Displayed**:
- `name` - User's full name
- `email` - User's email address
- `role` - User role (admin or user)
- `createdAt` - Account creation date
- `updatedAt` - Last update timestamp

**Excluded Fields** (as requested):
- ❌ `verifiedEmail` - Not displayed

### 5. Accounts Page Major Update
**File**: `app/dashboard/accounts/page.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Added user management integration
- ✅ Admin role check from cookie using `getUserInfo()`
- ✅ New API integration for fetching users with Authorization header
- ✅ Tabbed interface for admin users (Accounts vs Users)
- ✅ Separate views for regular users (accounts only)
- ✅ Filter support for users by role
- ✅ Loading states for both accounts and users

**New Features**:
1. **User Fetching**:
   ```typescript
   GET {NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BACKEND_URL}/users
   Headers: {
     "Authorization": "Bearer {accessToken}"
   }
   ```

2. **Tabbed Interface** (Admin Only):
   - **Accounts Tab**: Shows all accounts with existing functionality
   - **Users Tab**: Shows all users with filtering capability

3. **Role-Based UI**:
   - **Admin users**: See tabs, can create users, view user list
   - **Regular users**: See only accounts, no user management

4. **Filter Updates**:
   - Changed `leaderFilter` to `roleFilter`
   - Filter works for both accounts (leader/member) and users (admin/user)

**API Integration**:
- Uses `getAccessToken()` to retrieve Bearer token from cookie
- Passes token in Authorization header for user API calls
- Handles authentication errors gracefully

### 6. Authentication Integration
**Library Used**: `lib/auth.ts`

**Key Functions Used**:
- `getUserInfo()`: Retrieves user information from cookies/localStorage
  - Returns `UserInfo` object with `role` field
  - Role field: `"admin"` | `"user"` | undefined
- `getAccessToken()`: Retrieves access token from cookie
  - Used for API authentication
  - Returns Bearer token string

## Security Implementation

### Frontend Protection
1. **UI Level**: "Create User" button and Users tab only visible to admins
2. **Component Level**: Modal shows "Access Denied" for non-admin users
3. **Form Level**: Submit handler validates admin role before API call
4. **API Level**: Authorization header required for user API calls

### Backend Protection (Expected)
The backend API should validate that:
- Only authenticated users with valid tokens can access endpoints
- Only users with `role: "admin"` can create users
- Only users with `role: "admin"` can view user list
- Input validation for all required fields

## User Flow

### For Admin Users
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/accounts`
2. System checks role from cookie (via `getUserInfo()`)
3. See tabbed interface with "Accounts" and "Users" tabs
4. See both "Create Account" and "Create User" buttons
5. **Create User Flow**:
   - Click "Create User" button
   - Fill in user information (name, email, password, role)
   - Submit to create user via `POST /users` API
   - User list refreshes automatically
6. **View Users Flow**:
   - Click "Users" tab
   - See table of all users with filtering options
   - View user roles, creation dates, etc.

### For Regular Users
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/accounts`
2. System checks role from cookie (via `getUserInfo()`)
3. See only accounts interface (no tabs)
4. See only "Create Account" button
5. Cannot access user creation or user list
6. If they somehow access the modal, they see "Access Denied" message

## UI/UX Changes

### Terminology Updates
- "Leader" → "Admin" (throughout the application)
- "Leader Account" → "Admin Account"
- "Leader Role" → "Admin Role"

### New Components
- User table with role badges
- Tabbed navigation for admin users
- Role-based conditional rendering

### Visual Indicators
- Shield icon for admin users
- User icon for regular users
- Color-coded badges (default for admin, secondary for user)
- Tab icons for better navigation

## API Endpoints Summary

### Accounts
- `GET /accounts` - Fetch all accounts
- `POST /accounts` - Create new account
- `PATCH /accounts/:id` - Update account info (name, emails, admin status)
- `DELETE /accounts/:id` - Delete account

### Users (Admin Only)
- `GET /users` - Fetch all users (requires Authorization header)
- `POST /users` - Create new user (requires admin role)

### Response Format (Users)
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "string",
    "googleId": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "role": "admin" | "user",
    "createdAt": "ISO date string",
    "updatedAt": "ISO date string"
  }
]
```

**Note**: `verifiedEmail` field excluded from UI display as requested.
